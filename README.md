# NSFW as a Service: The Firewall for Your Eyeballs

A coin-operated private-label AI API pipeline for systems that cannot afford ambiguity. Built to ensure users are not sending prohibited content to upstream commercial providers or downstream to consumers or the public, this service provides high-velocity content classification for the discerning operator. It is designed for platforms that demand consistent results, total operational control, and clean integration into existing pipelines. No public endpoints, no shared models, and no drama—just a bulletproof gatekeeper that stops bad data before it contaminates your environment.

**The Engine.** The open-source core of our NSFW as a Service in 'host it yourself' format. A CLIP-based image and video filter that flags NSFW content and runs locally. It uses either a rules-based policy or a user-trained classifier to give you total sovereignty over your ingest and generative media workflows. It supports batch processing, GPU acceleration, and video frame sampling, providing a heavy-duty safety layer without relying on external services.
